## Features

This repository contains the following features:

- Git operations (sync, clone, pull, push, etc.) with volumes in containers.
- Git operations with volumes in Kubernetes pods using a sidecar container and a shared volume. The idea is to use the same volume in different pods as the former and deprecated "git-repo" volume kind did. The difference with the previous example is that the volume is created by the sidecar container and then shared with the main container.
- Ephememeral volumes in Kubernetes pods using a sidecar container and a shared volume. The idea is to use the same volume in different pods as the former and deprecated "git-repo" volume kind did. The difference with the previous example is that the volume is created by the init container and then shared with the main container. In this case the volume is destroyed when the pod is terminated, but the data is persisted in the repository, so the volume can be recreated later and the data will be persisted and synchronized.
- Etc.

## Entrypoint (According to Github Copilot)

> This is a shell script called entrypoint.sh that sets up Git credentials and user information, and then checks if the content directory is a Git repository. If it is, the script pulls, adds, commits, and pushes changes to the remote repository every $GIT_SYNC_INTERVAL (an environment variable that specifies the time interval in seconds between each sync). If the content directory is not a Git repository, the script clones the remote repository specified by $GIT_REPO_URL with the branch $GIT_BRANCH into the content directory, and then pushes changes to the remote repository every $GIT_SYNC_INTERVAL.
>
> The script first sets environment variables for Git credentials and user information. If $GIT_USERNAME and $GIT_PASSWORD are both set, the script sets up Git credentials using the store helper and writes them to a file called .git-credentials in the /git directory. If $GIT_TOKEN is set, the script sets up Git credentials using the store helper and writes them to the .git-credentials file. If $GIT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64 is set, the script creates a .ssh directory in the /git directory, decodes the base64-encoded private key, writes it to a file called id_rsa in the .ssh directory, sets the file permissions to 600, adds the GitHub host key to the known_hosts file in the .ssh directory, and sets the core.sshCommand Git configuration to use the private key.
>
> The script then sets up Git user information by setting the user.name and user.email Git configurations to $GIT_USERNAME and $GIT_USER_EMAIL, respectively.
>
> The script then checks if the content directory is a Git repository by checking if the .git directory exists in the content directory. If it does, the script changes the working directory to the content directory and sets the safe.directory Git configuration to /git/content. The script then enters an infinite loop that pulls changes from the remote repository, adds changes to the local repository, commits changes to the local repository with a commit message that includes the current date and time, and pushes changes to the remote repository with the branch $GIT_BRANCH. If any of these steps fail, the script prints an error message to stderr and exits with a non-zero status code. The script then sleeps for $GIT_SYNC_INTERVAL seconds before starting the loop again.
> 
> If the content directory is not a Git repository, the script clones the remote repository specified by $GIT_REPO_URL with the branch $GIT_BRANCH into the content directory using the clone command with the --single-branch and --branch options. The script then sets the file permissions of the content directory to 777 (read, write, and execute permissions for all users). If the clone command fails, the script prints an error message to stderr and exits with a non-zero status code. The script then prints a success message to stdout and exits with a zero status code.
